        <h3>NESW Workshop</h3>
        <h3>Telling Science Stories with Code and Data</h3>   
      </div>
      <div id="nav"></div>
      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      
      <p>Computation and data analysis are fundamental tools in almost all the sciences today. The same tools can also help journalists and other communicators explain and present science stories to the wider public. On Saturday April 18, 2015, New England Science Writers will host a one-day workshop for science writers who want to get up to speed with code and data and use these tools to find new ways to tell science stories. The event has the financial support of the National Association of Science Writers and will use facilities generously donated by the MIT Media Lab.</p>
      
      <p>In advance of the workshop, this website provides information for those registered to attend. After the workshop, the site will become a public showcase for the work created by the participants.</p>
      
      
      <h4>What We’ll Learn</h4>
      
      <p>Code and data can enter into scientific storytelling in many ways. Sometimes you gather the data yourself, and it <em>becomes</em> the story, as with investigations of funding or publication patterns in the sciences. Sometimes the data set is a product of scientific research—say, a reconstruction of global climate over the past few centuries—and you want to extract trends that might be of particular interest to your readers. Or you might present the whole data set in a way that allows those readers to explore it for themselves. On other occasions, data isn’t a major part of the story; you simply want to explain an idea or a mechanism, and an interactive illustration is the best way to do it.</p>
      
      <p>Just 10 years ago, getting started with this kind of computer programming meant climbing quite a steep learning curve. Working with data sets large enough to be of wide interest required hardware and software that was out of reach for most of us. But technology marches on. It’s amazing what you can do these days with a little learning, a laptop, and freely available software.</p>
            
      <p>In the workshop we’ll focus on two programming languages. Python has become an essential tool throughout the sciences, largely because an enthusiastic community has extended the language with easily installed modules for everything from statistics to natural-language processing. JavaScript is the language of the Web; it allows you to embed programs in any web page.</p>
      
      <p>We have provided detailed <a href="instructions.html">instructions</a> for downloading and installing the software you’ll need to work with Python and JavaScript. (Please don’t wait til the last minute.)</p>

      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      
      <p>Computation and data analysis are fundamental tools in almost all the sciences today. The same tools can also help journalists and other communicators explain and present science stories to the wider public. On Saturday April 18, 2015, New England Science Writers will host a one-day workshop for science writers who want to get up to speed with code and data. The event has the financial support of the National Association of Science writers and will use facilities generously donated by the MIT Media Lab.</p>
      
      <p>In advance of the workshop, this website provides information for those registered to attend. After the workshop, the site will become a public showcase for the work created by the participants.</p>

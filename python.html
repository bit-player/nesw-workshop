      <h2>A Python Primer</h2>

      <p>Why learn Python? It is a hugely popular language for data analysis, and scientific computing. It is a simple language to learn, yet extremely powerful, mostly because almost all scientists use it, and thus there are libraries to do almost anything in the language. There are libraries for simulation, statistical analysis, and natutal language processing, for example. It will help you make fast computations with random numbers, make quick exploratory graphs for a dataset, and munge and clean text and data</p>
      <p>The first thing you ought to do is to install the Anaconda Distribution, and bring up the Jupyter Notebook interface, as detailed on the <a href="instructions.html">instructions</a> page. Here are two notebooks to help you get started.</p>
      <p>
      <p>If you are completely new to Python, you ought to check out the <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mbakker7/exploratory_computing_with_python/blob/master/notebook1/py_exploratory_comp_1_sol.ipynb">first notebook</a>  of the <a href="http://mbakker7.github.io/exploratory_computing_with_python/">Exploratory Computing with Python"</a> primer listed on our resources page. You can download the notebook by pressing the download icon at upper right in the Jupyter browser window. Then navigate to your download folder within Jupiter and open it locally. It moves through the basics rather nicely. After you have worked through it, you might wish to turn your attention to the next two notebooks.
      </p>
      <p>For the next two notebooks, you might want to use the <b>workspace</b>link at the upper right corner of the page.
        If you click on this link, you will be taken to a login page. Choose a (uniqueish) username there, and you will be taken to the dropbox web site to give permissions to our app <b>ipynbox</b> which will provide you a Dropbox folder <tt>Dropbox/Apps/ipynbox</tt> in your dropbox with a folder <tt>nbs</tt> with the below two ipython notebooks. You can then start Jupyter right in that folder. The data files are also provided in there.</p>

        <p>I'd suggest working in that folder as well, you'll be able to (privately) see all your work online.</p>
        
      <p> If you have programmed before, this fast moving <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/first_this.ipynb">first</a> notebook ( introduces some of the basic syntax, data types, control structures, and flow in the language through a series of examples. You can download the notebook by pressing the download icon at upper right in the Jupyter browser window. Then navigate to your download folder within Jupiter and open it locally. Run it cell by cell, change things, and play around!</p>
      <p> The data file hamlet.txt referred to in this notebook can be downloaded <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/hamlet.txt">here</a></p>
      <p>One of the great things about Python is that people have created toolkits, or libraries, that give Python users superpowers. The <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/Pandas_the_Spreadsheet.ipynb">second</a> notebook introduces <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, a Python library for managing, analyzing and modeling spreadsheet-formatted data. You can also familiarize yourself with Pandas by watching Wes McKinney's <a href="https://vimeo.com/59324550">10-minute video tour</a>.
      </p>
      <p>The data set used in this notebook is one we scraped from the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> web site for another workshop. We walk through loading, manipulating, and saving data from it. <p>
      <p>It can be found <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/cleaned.csv">here</a>. Download it and save it somewhere on your system (easiest if you save it in the same folder you started the ipython notebook from).</p>
      <p>The data is in Comma Separated Value (csv) form, which represents items by rows, with data features separated by commas. The first line is usually taken to be the column heads. You can save data in csv format from Numbers and Excel, when playing with your own data.</p>
<p> Finally, here is the presentation day notebook: <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/elnino.ipynb">El Nino</a></p>

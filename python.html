      <h2>A Python Primer</h2>
      <p>The first thing you ought to do is to install the Anaconda Distribution, and bring up the Jupyter Notebook interface, as detailed on the <a href="instructions.html">instructions</a> page. Here are two notebooks to help you get started.</p>
      <p> The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/first_this.ipynb">first</a> notebook introduces some of the basic syntax, data types, control structures, and flow in the language through a series of examples. Download the notebook, run it cell by cell, change things, and play around!</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/Pandas_the_Spreadsheet.ipynb">second</a> notebook introduces <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, a python library for treating data like a spreadsheet, programatically. The data set used is one we scraped from the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> web site. We walk through loading, manipulating, and saving data<p>.
      <p>The data file for this Notebook can be found <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/75194/cleaned.csv">here</a>. Download it and save it somewhere on your system (easiest if you save it in the same folder you started the ipython notebook from).</p>
      <p>The data is in Comma Separated Value (csv) form, which (as it says) represents items by rows, with data features separated by commas. The first line is usually taken to be the column heads. You can save data in csv format from Numbers and Excel, when playing with your own data.</p>

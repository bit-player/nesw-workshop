      <h4>The Geography of Solar Energy</h4>
      <h5>Group members: Kat Friedrich, Cara Giaimo, David Holzman, and Kim Krieger</h5>
      <p>In which states is public opinion most likely to support expansion of solar power – and in which states is that expansion likely to occur? To seek answers to these questions, we created an Excel spreadsheet combining state data from the following two sources:</p> 
      <ol>
         <li>Yale’s new map showing public sentiment supporting 20 percent renewable electricity mandates.</li>
        <li>Data from <a href="http://www.dsireusa.org/">DSIRE</a> about favorable policies for renewable energy (net metering, power purchase agreements, and renewable portfolio standards).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Because the 20 percent renewable electricity mandate may include resources other than solar power, there is likely to be some overlap with other technologies. We experimented with creating maps based on this composite spreadsheet using Python. Our final product for this training was a map of Yale’s public opinion data, color-coded in orange.</p>

      <h3>NESW Workshop</h3>
      <h3>Telling Science Stories with Code and Data</h3>
      <h2>Instructions for Participants</h2>
      
      <p>Our workshop will be a hands-on event. You&rsquo;ll be writing, testing, and debugging your own programs on your own computer. At the end of the day, we want you to go home with a completed project that works. To make all this happen, you&rsquo;ll need to do some advance preparation. In particular, it&rsquo;s important that everyone arrive on Saturday morning with the necessary software already installed and working.</p>

      <h4>What to Bring</h4>
      
      <p>You will need a reasonably modern laptop computer, with working wifi, an up-to-date web browser, and enough available space on the disk drive for the software we&rsquo;re about to install. </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Windows computers should be running Windows Vista or later (version 7, 8, or 8.1).</li>
        <li>Macintosh computers need OS X version 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) or later.</li>
        <li>What about Linux? Should work, but we&rsquo;re not giving step-by-step instructions.</li>
        <li>Google Chrome is the recommended web browser, but Firefox, Opera, or Safari should be fine too. If you prefer Internet Explorer, please make sure it&rsquo;s the latest version.</li>
        <li>Installing the programming-language software will fill up about 1.1 gigabytes (1100 megabytes) of free disk space, and you&rsquo;ll briefly need even more than that during the down-load-and-install process. If you are short of disk space, please see the <a href="#squeezing">note below</a>. All of the software can easily be removed after the workshop, if you need to recover the space used.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Don&rsquo;t forget to bring your power cord and charger!</p>
        
      
      <h4>Installing Python</h4>
      
      <p>In the workshop we&rsquo;ll be exploring two programming ecosystems: Python for data analysis (and just about any other kind of computing), and JavaScript for building interactive storytelling aids. Let&rsquo;s start with Python.</p>
       
      <p>Even if you already have a version of Python on your machine, we suggest installing the Anaconda distribution from Continuum Analytics and using it for the workshop. It won&rsquo;t interfere with your existing setup, and you can remove it later with no fuss.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Go to <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">http://continuum.io/downloads/</a>. You should be offered an installer tailored to your operating system.

        (If you&rsquo;re offered the wrong choice, click one of the three icons at the top of the panel—windowpane, apple, tux.)</li>
        <li>Unless you&rsquo;re a command-line guru, you probably want the &ldquo;Graphical Installer.&rdquo;</li>
        <li>Please choose Python version 2.7, which is the default option, not Python 3.4.</li>
        <li>Click the button to start the download. Now might be a good time to get a cup of coffee; it&rsquo;s a big file.</li>
        <li>Note: You might see a message warning that &ldquo;This kind of file could harm your computer.&rdquo; Click the button to live dangerously.</li>
        <li>When the download completes, you should have a <code>.pkg</code> file on Macintosh or an <code>.exe</code> file on Windows. In either case, double-click it.</li>
        <li>The installer program has its own on-screen instructions, and there's also a <a href="http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html">walk-through</a> on the Anaconda website.</li>
        <li>You need to choose a place to put the software. On Macintosh the default choice is your home directory. The installer may display an error message: “You cannot install Anaconda in this location.” In fact you can, if you just click another choice and then return to the home-folder selection. Or you can put it anywhere else you’d like, such as the main &ldquo;Applications&rdquo; folder. (You may be asked for an administrator password.)</li>
        <li>If all goes well, you’ll get a message saying the installation was successful.</li>
        <li>And what if all <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> go well? You might find a LiveChat icon on the <a href="http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index.html#installation-instructions">Continuum.io install page</a>. There’s a <a href="http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/faq.html">FAQ</a>. There’s an <a href="https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues">Anaconda Issues</a> page on GitHub. There’s a <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/anaconda">Google Group</a> where you can ask for help. Or get in touch with us—the <a href="contact">workshop organizers</a>.</li>
        <li>Once you’ve completed the installation, you can throw away the installer (the <code>.pkg</code> or <code>.exe</code> file). </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Questions that Might Be Frequently Asked</h4>
      
      <p>Q. I already have Python set up the way I like it, and I'm happy with my own web-dev environment. Do I have to install the software you recommend?</p>
      <p>A. Of course not. But you might want to run the tests mentioned above </p>

      <h2>Code and Data in the Wild</h2>
      
      <p>Collected here are some examples of published science stories in which code and data contribute to the reporting or the presentation. Also included are a few notable works of data journalism outside the sciences, where the techniques used might well be useful to science writers. And miscellaneous other sources of inspiration.</p>
      
      <h4>Data-Driven Science Stories</h4>
